### Plinko.js

Plinko.js is a real-time browser-based multiplayer physics game. It was built using JavaScript, Node.js, WebSockets and React. Only native browser features are used and no special client-side plugins were included. The game features a client-server architecture which synchronizes game state for multiple clients in real time, allowing for live-action gameplay.
