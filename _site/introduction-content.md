### Plinko.js

Recently, I co-created an open-source multiplayer real-time browser-based physics game using JavaScript, Node.js, WebSockets and React. Using no client-side plugins and only relying on basic features of the browser, we built a client-server architecture to synchronize game state generated by a physics engine across the internet to multiple clients in real time, while facilitating live-action gameplay. We simulated a real time, lag free environment by analyzing state synchronization, binary data serialization, and protocol strategies.
