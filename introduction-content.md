My name is Josh Nelson and I'm a software engineer with 2 years of programming experience including working with React, Rails, Sinatra, and Backbone. I like building efficient solutions that make everyday life a little easier.
 
Before diving headfirst into programming, I was a Marketing Manager for a local community college. But ultimately, the coding bug bit me and I knew that I had no choice but to pursue my new-found passion.
