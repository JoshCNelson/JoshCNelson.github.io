title: About Me

Hello! I'm a software engineer with a management background from Portland State University. I enjoy tackling challenging problems and working with others to build robust systems.

For an example of my work, check out my latest project, <a href="http://plinkojs.com">Plinko.js</a>.

## Recent Projects

### Plinko.js

Recently, I co-created an open-source multiplayer real-time browser-based physics game using JavaScript, Node.js, WebSockets and React. Using no client-side plugins and only relying on basic features of the browser, we built a client-server architecture to synchronize game state generated by a physics engine across the internet to multiple clients in real time, while facilitating live-action gameplay. We simulated a real time, lag free environment by analyzing state synchronization, binary data serialization, latency estimation, and protocol strategies.

### Reaction

Reaction is a partial clone of the popular Trello project management productivity app with CRUD operations on cards and lists, as well as scheduling and tagging. It was designed using React for the front-end, Redux for the in-browser data store, with a Rails back-end API and PostgreSQL database.
