Hello! I'm a software engineer with 2 years of programming experience working with technologies such as React, Node, Rails, and Backbone. I enjoy tackling challenging problems and working with others to build robust systems.

For an example of my work, check out my latest project, <a href="http://plinkojs.com">Plinko.js</a>.

### Plinko.js

Recently, I co-created an open-source multiplayer real-time browser-based physics game using JavaScript, Node.js, WebSockets and React. Using no client-side plugins and only relying on basic features of the browser, we built a client-server architecture to synchronize game state generated by a physics engine across the internet to multiple clients in real time, while facilitating live-action gameplay. We simulated a real time, lag free environment by analyzing state synchronization, binary data serialization, latency estimation, and protocol strategies.
